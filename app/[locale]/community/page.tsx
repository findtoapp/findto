            <h2>Welcome to Findto</h2>
            <p>
              Findto is an assistant for decentralized search on Web and AI.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are developing a completely new search experience â€” free and
              open source.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our mission is to empower people by introducing a better way to
              interact with the Web and AI. We're putting the control of search
              algorithms into people's hands.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why? Because we are dissatisfied. We want to break every monopoly
              that forces us to have a monocular view of the internet and limits
              our potential. We believe Findto can offer diverse, innovative
              ways to explore the internet, and their best services, positively
              impacting our digital lives.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as we choose what we eat, wear, date or elect, who said we
              can't choose our search sources? Yes, we are bold. We deeply
              believe in the power of choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Findto is created by passionate individuals like you. Join us and
              get involved!

            <h2>Researching Web and AI</h2>
            <p>
              We are researching and are interested in partnerships with
              services to strengthen technologies of open access, decentralized
              web, responsible AI, privacy, web accessibility, carbon
              neutrality, diversity, and digital democracy. Findto is committed
              to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.
            </p>
