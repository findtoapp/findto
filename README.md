## 🌎 Decentralized search assistant

Findto is a free and open source assistant for decentralized web search.

The mission of Findto is to make searches truly free and more productive, putting people in control of algorithms and AIs — not the other way around.

Findto proposes an enhanced web search experience: you control diverse sources, view the privacy score of them, discover trending contents, and choose better results.

The centralized web, where our searches are monopolized, is over. Findto encourages everyone to discover a more diverse, healthier, secure, and democratic web. Where your choices matter.
