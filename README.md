Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/lucasm/findto/wiki) for details.

## 💡 Motivation

The centralization of the Web in Big Techs is not positive.

The Web is bigger than the biggest players.

Sometimes we forgot how important is bring new digital solutions and experiences, for diversity, inspiration, competition, personal knowledge and even strengthen our democracies.

How make searches really free? How to put people in control of the search algorithms (not the inverse)? How privative is this search? What are others searching on this subject? Where else can I search?

These questions brought Findto to life.
