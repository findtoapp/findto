## 🌎 Decentralized search assistant

Findto is an assistant for decentralized web search powered by diverse sources, AI and privacy control.

Findto mission is to make searches truly free and more productive, putting people in control of algorithms and AIs — not the other way around.

Findto proposes a new web search experience: you control powerful sources, view the privacy level and chose better results.
